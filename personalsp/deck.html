            <p class="sk8deck">The most notable component of a skateboard is the deck. The deck is the wooden part of
                the skateboard that you stand on. The majority of skateboard decks are made out of 7 ply’s of maple and
                are glued together. The ply’s are put into a hydraulic press and that is what gives a skateboard curves.
                After the deck comes out of the press somebody shapes it and drills mounting holes into the deck. The
                curves include the nose and tail, which are the parts that go up on either end. Then there is the
                concave. Concave allows the skateboard to not just be flat in the middle. This allows for more grip and
                makes it easier for certain tricks.</p>
            <p class="grippara">The only other component to it is the grip tape which is the black part on top. The grip
                tape is just a big sandpaper stick that you put on top of the deck, so you have grip while riding. These
                two components are what wear out the fastest and need to be replaced the most. </p>
