                <div class="truckspara">The most expensive part of a skateboard is the trucks, but this last the longest.
                    Trucks are
                   made up of a few parts: The hanger, baseplate, and bushings. The hanger is the part of the truck with
                   the axle inside of it and it is the part of the truck that wears down the fastest from doing certain
                   tricks like grinds. The hanger is attached to the baseplate which is the part of the truck that connects
                   to the deck using bolts. The base plate has a kingpin, which is a bolt that goes through it that allows
                   the hanger to connect. There is also a rubber cup inside of the base plate called a pivot bushing, this
                   helps protect the baseplate from wear from the hanger. There is also bushings that go on the kingpin,
                   these make it so the trucks can be tightened down without damaging anything. Some bushings are softer
                   than others to allow the truck to turn easier or harder. There are many different truck brands and they
                   all have their own geometry for their trucks. Geometry is important because it makes the skateboard turn
                   and feel a certain way.</div>
                <div class="wheelspara">Skateboard wheels come in many different shapes, sizes, and hardness levels. Most
                    wheels are made of urethane. The softer the wheel the easier it is to ride over cracks and pebbles. The
                    harder the wheel, the easier it is to slide and the faster you go. People want to slide for certain
                    tricks.</div>
