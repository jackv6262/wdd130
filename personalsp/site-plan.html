      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My website, Jack's Skateboard Anatomy, will help people understand the physical makeup of a skateboard. The average person most likely can’t name every part of skateboard and some people have the drive to name these parts. My website will make it easy to understand the different parts and components of a skateboard by having pictures and informative captions about what that specific part does on a skateboard. I will also use colors and fonts that make it easy to read and hopefully be attention grabbing to the audience.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My website is for anybody that wants to learn the anatomy of a skateboard and know what each part of the skateboard does. Anybody can benefit from this website, but it will be very informative to people getting into skateboarding and parents that want to buy a skateboard for their children. There are also some people that just like to learn new things, so this website will be great for them if they do not already know the anatomy of a skateboard.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        [Welcome to Jack’s Skateboard Anatomy, this website will help you learn the different parts of a skateboard, what each part does, and where each part goes. It doesn’t matter if you are a skateboard expert or if you don’t even know what a skateboard is, this website will be beneficial to you. Jack’s Skateboard Anatomy is broken down into three pages, “Home” page, “Deck” page, and “Trucks and Wheels” page. ]
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>[Deck]</h3>
      <p>
        [Deck: The most notable component of a skateboard is the deck. The deck is the wooden part of the skateboard that you stand on. The majority of skateboard decks are made out of 7 ply’s of maple and are glued together. The ply’s are put into a hydraulic press and that is what gives a skateboard curves. After the deck comes out of the press somebody shapes it and drills mounting holes into the deck. The curves include the nose and tail, which are the parts that go up on either end. Then there is the concave. Concave allows the skateboard to not just be flat in the middle. This allows for more grip and makes it easier for certain tricks.]
      </p>
      <p>Grip tape: The only other component to it is the grip tape which is the black part on top. The grip tape is just a big sandpaper stick that you put on top of the deck, so you have grip while riding. These two components are what wear out the fastest and need to be replaced the most.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Trucks and Wheels]</h3>
      <p>
        [Trucks: The most expensive part of a skateboard is the trucks, but this last the longest. Trucks are kind of like car axles, you put wheels on them and then they attach to the deck. Trucks are made up of a few parts: The hanger, baseplate, and bushings. The hanger is the part of the truck with the axle inside of it and it is the part of the truck that wears down the fastest from doing certain tricks like grinds. The hanger is attached to the baseplate which is the part of the truck that connects to the deck using bolts. The base plate has a kingpin, which is a bolt that goes through it that allows the hanger to connect. There is also a rubber cup inside of the base plate called a pivot bushing, this helps protect the baseplate from wear from the hanger. There is also bushings that go on the kingpin, these make it so the trucks can be tightened down without damaging anything. Some bushings are softer than others to allow the truck to turn easier or harder.
        There are many different truck brands and they all have their own geometry for their trucks. Geometry is important because it makes the skateboard turn and feel a certain way. Trucks are made of metal and are very durable.]
      </p>
      <p>[Wheels: Skateboard wheels come in many different shapes, sizes, and hardness levels. Most wheels are made of urethane. The softer the wheel the easier it is to ride over cracks and pebbles. The harder the wheel, the easier it is to slide and the faster you go. People want to slide for certain tricks.]
      </p>
      <p>[Bearings: Bearings go inside of a wheel so that the wheel can fit onto the truck axle and turn efficiently.]
